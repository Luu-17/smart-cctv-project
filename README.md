# smart-cctv-project

Alarm function (works)  
Object Detection (works)  
Surveillance (works)

## How to Run

To start the software, run `run.py` in your terminal or IDE:

```bash
python run.py
```

The project is **still in progress** and may have bugs or incomplete features.

**Problem:** It currently opens a new screen for every frame.  
**Solution:** Debug the display logic or keep surveillance on, then switch to YOLOv8 when the time hits
